## Project List<a name="ProjectList"></a>

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/HelpImages/projectlist.png" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow">

To view a project’s summary, click the Project ID. 

To quickly add/edit a form, click the blue plus “+” icon for the project. 

The Project List can be filtered as needed using the filter area at the top of the screen, or by using the keyword search located just over the Project ID column. 

Newly created projects will feature a bouncing red exclamation icon. This icon serves as a reminder to applicants that the project is not considered sent/submitted to LED until an Advance or Application form as been submitted. Business Incentive Programs require and Advance Notification. Entertainment Incentives have no Advance Notification; therefore, an Application must be submitted.

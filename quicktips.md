### How do I sign my Certification?

LED utilizes a tool called Adobe Sign. Adobe Document Cloud solution is a cloud-based, enterprise-class e-signature service that lets you replace paper and ink signature processes with fully automated electronic signature workflows. With it, you can easily send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device.

When a certification is ready for execution, LED will trigger the document workflow through Adobe Sign.

For **Initial Certifications**, the Business Signatory (project contact) will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certification Attesations**, the Authorized Representative will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certifications**, Fastlane will notify the project contacts when the document is executed. Follow the instructions provided in the email and access the executed document via Fastlane.

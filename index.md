### How do I sign my Certification?

LED utilizes a tool called Adobe Sign. Adobe Document Cloud solution is a cloud-based, enterprise-class e-signature service that lets you replace paper and ink signature processes with fully automated electronic signature workflows. With it, you can easily send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device.

When a certification is ready for execution, LED will trigger the document workflow through Adobe Sign.

For **Initial Certifications**, the Business Signatory (project contact) will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certification Attesations**, the Authorized Representative will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certifications**, Fastlane will notify the project contacts when the document is executed. Follow the instructions provided in the email and access the executed document via Fastlane.

FNG has three Contact Types – Business Signatory, Business, and Consultant. 

### Business Signatory — REQUIRED

The Business Signatory MUST have legal authority to sign project forms. The Business Signatory contact type is required to electronically sign various forms throughout the course of the project.

The Business Signatory is/has:

- Legal signature authority
- Authorized Representative for Company/Project

The Business Signatory contact person CANNOT sign Contract documents unless they are designated as the CONTRACT SIGNATORY in the Project. 

There can only be ONE Business Signatory. 

### Business

The Business contact type is any person that needs to be contacted regarding a project.

There can be multiple Business contacts. 

### Consultant

A Consultant can file on behalf of a company and act as the company representative for a project, providing they have legal consent. This contact type is typically only used for Business Incentive Programs but can also apply for both Entertainment Incentives as well. 

A CONTRACT SIGNATORY must still be assigned in the Project. 

A Consultant contact type CANNOT sign Contract documents.

There can be multiple Consultant contacts.

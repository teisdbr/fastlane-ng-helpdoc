### How Long Does it Take?

OEID works to process any and all submissions in a timely manner. The timeframes below are approximations, there may be extenuating circumstance that arise which could extend processing time. If you have any questions about your submission, please don’t hesitate to contact the administrative team.

### How is a Certification signed?

LED utilizes a tool called Adobe Sign. Adobe Document Cloud solution is a cloud-based, enterprise-class e-signature service that lets you replace paper and ink signature processes with fully automated electronic signature workflows. With it, you can easily send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device.

When a certification is ready for execution, LED will trigger the document workflow through Adobe Sign.

For **Initial Certifications**, the Business Signatory (project contact) will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certification Attesations**, the Authorized Representative will receive an email notification via email from Adobe from echosign@echosign.com. Follow the instructions in the email, click the provided link, and sign the document via Adobe Sign.

For **Final Certifications**, Fastlane will notify the project contacts when the document is executed. Follow the instructions provided in the email and access the executed document via Fastlane.

<img src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/Help/AdobeSignHowTo.gif" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow">



### How to process a document Executed outside of FastLane (Manual Execution)

If a document cannot be fully processed using the eSignature tool, the following steps should be taken. 

1. Upload the physically signed document into the project attachments. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Manage Project Attachments.) Correctly label the uploaded document. 

2. Add a project comment explaining why the document wasn’t executed using eSign. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Project Comments.)

3. If the executed document would have changed the overall project status, then the manager should change it accordingly. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Update Project Status.)

4. xIf the executed document would have triggered critical date population, then the manager should add these dates accordingly. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Manage Critical Dates.)

5. The eSign status for this document will remain as is (if there is one.) This is because the digital version of this document is stuck in that current status because the process was interrupted. 



## Confidential Projects

If a Project is considered "confidential" the Project **must be marked "confidential" 24-hours prior** to Advance submission. If the Project is marked "confidential" after Advance submission, it is possible that the Project information may be released to the public.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/HelpImages/projectcreated.png" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow">

Projects that are created together will have the same project number but will be followed by a different acronym per incentive program. 

### Project ID<a name="ProjectID"></a>

The Project ID (also known as contract number) is a system generated number that is the is the year the project was created followed by four numbers ending in the hyphenated incentive program abbreviation.

Project Phases will add the hyphenated phase letter designation before the incentive program.

Partial Transfers will add "-PT" before the incentive program.

Examples: 20009999-ITE, 20009999-A-ITE, 20009999-PT-ITE, and 20009999-A-PT-ITE

**Note:** The Entertainment ID for FILM and DM are assigned by the Entertainment Incentive manager while processing the application.

## Request Project Access<a name="projectaccess"></a>

If a user needs to access to a project that is not currently in the Project List, the user needs to request access to the project. 

To request access, enter the Project ID and search for the project. This must be the Project ID and not the Entertainment ID. 

If the Project ID is correct, additional information will be required. 

If the account holder is considered a “Third Party Consultant” to the project which they are requesting access, they must answer “Yes” and attach proof they have permission from the company to access this project. 

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/Help/RequestProjectAccess.gif" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow">

***All access requests are reviewed by LED Managers. The approval process is NOT immediate. This can typically take 24-48 hours.*** 

The user is notified on screen when the request is submitted. The system will also send an email to the LED Manager for the corresponding incentive program. 

Whether the access request is approved or denied, the user will be notified via email.

#### What if a form is not available to send?

If a form is not available to send, investigate the following:

  - If so, go to the “Manage Forms in Review Process” page an click the trash can for that form and agency review status. 



### Manage Forms in Review Process

When a form has been sent for review by an external agency, the agency will receive an email notification to log into FNG and take action. Should the agency not take action, but instead communicate the action to an LED manager, the LED manager will use the “Manager Forms in Review Process” screen.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/HelpImages/MGMT-ManageExt.png" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow">

The manage scree bares a strong resemblance to the external review portals, but it has the ability to manage all external agency actions instead of just one. The screen can be filtered by incentive program, form type, external review status, external agency and received date range. There is also a check box to denote received within the last 90 days. 

Once the filters are selected, and the correct projects/forms are displayed in the search results, the following actions can be taken. 

- **No Objection** (also known as Approved for RTA) – this means that the external agency has no issues with the project and form, and it is approved to go before the board. For RTA, the LGA will approve the project and an approval resolution must be uploaded upon clicking the Approval action. 
- **Objection** (also known as Denied for RTA) – this means that the external agency has an objection to the project and form, and it needs to be rectified before it can be put on the board. For RTA, the LGA will deny the project and a denial resolution must be uploaded upon click the Deny action. 
  - If there is an objection, an email will be sent to the project contacts and the LED manager with proper email settings.

- **Objection Lifted** – any objections on the project or form have been lifted. The form can now be brought before the board.
  - When an objection is lifted, an email will be sent to the project contacts and the LED manager with proper email settings.
- **Trash/Remove** – this will remove the form from the current review status. 
  - If a form needs to be resubmitted for review, remove it from the current status and resend.

#### View Agenda

If any attachments were uploaded in the “Manage Agenda Attachments” area, they will display in the attachment area. 

Below the attachments, is the agenda summary, which gives a snapshot view of the agenda’s contents. 

Below the snapshot, is each incentives board summary. Select an incentive program to see the summaries per form which are on the selected agenda. 

To download the forms on the board agenda, click the blue download icon. The icon at the top of each section will download all forms in that section. The icon per each row, will download the form for that project.

## Signatures 

The Signatures area allows users to send and manage documents in the eSignature process. Note that this section does not manage the status of manually signed documents. The status of document in a workflow depends on the communication with the Adobe Sign API. 

#### Adobe Sign

Adobe Sign, an Adobe Document Cloud solution is a cloud-based, enterprise-class e-signature service that lets you replace paper and ink signature processes with fully automated electronic signature workflows. With it, you can easily send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device. 

Fastlane uses this third-party API to process all documents that require execution.

Portal URL: https://secure.echosign.com/public/login

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/HelpImages/mgmt-adobe1.png" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow"> 

Important notes regarding signatures: 

For Business Incentive Programs:

- A Contract Signatory is required for Contract, Renewal Contract, and Contract Amendments. The “Send Forms for Signature” page will not allow a document to be sent for signature if this is missing.
- Fastlane sends an email to all project contacts when a Contract, Renewal Contract, and Contract Amendments workflow has been triggered. This allows consultants and projects contacts to know when documents are in queue. 
- Fastlane sends an email to all project contacts when a Contract, Renewal Contract, and Contract Amendment has been executed. 

For Entertainment Programs:

- A Business Signatory contact type must be present in order to send the Initial Cert for eSignature. 
- An Authorized Representative/Irrevocable Designee must be assigned in order to send the Final Cert Attestations and the Audit/Final Cert for eSignature. 
- The email notification to project contact alerting them that a document in in queue for signature has been disabled for Entertainment Programs, per request of the Entertainment Managers. 
- The Final Cert workflow does not include the company/applicant contact. The users will not receive a copy of the final executed document unless they follow instructions in the Executed email that Fastlane send the project contacts. They must log into Fastlane to access the Executed Final Cert. 
- The DM Initial and Final Certification executed emails have additional instructional.



### Manage Forms in Process

“Manage Forms in Process” page is used to manage documents/forms currently in queue for a signature workflow.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/fastlane-public-files/Images/HelpImages/mgmt-managesign.png" width="800" class="ml-4 boxshadow"> 

To filter the page, sort by program type, document type, sent date range and/or agreement status. 

The agreement/signature status identifies where the document is in the eSignature workflow. 

Statuses are as follows:

- Sent to Manager

- Sent to Company 

- Sent to Reviewer

- Sent to Undersecretary

- Sent to Governor

- Executed

- Cancelled 

- Voided


To view the signature history of a document, click the clock icon. 

To cancel a current document in flow, click the red cancel icon. 

To resend a document currently in flow, click the teal paper airplane icon. 

To download an executed document, click the download icon. 

To void and executed document, click the “x.” 



### Manually Executing Documents

If a document cannot be fully processed using the eSignature tool, the following steps should be taken. 

1. Upload the physically signed document into the project attachments. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Manage Project Attachments.) Correctly label the uploaded document. 

2. Add a project comment explaining why the document wasn’t executed using eSign. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Project Comments.)

3. If the executed document would have changed the overall project status, then the manager should change it accordingly. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Update Project Status.)

4. If the executed document would have triggered critical date population, then the manager should add these dates accordingly. (Project Summary > Hamburger Menu > Manage Critical Dates.)

5. The eSign status for this document will remain as is (if there is one.) This is because the digital version of this document is stuck in that current status because the process was interrupted.
